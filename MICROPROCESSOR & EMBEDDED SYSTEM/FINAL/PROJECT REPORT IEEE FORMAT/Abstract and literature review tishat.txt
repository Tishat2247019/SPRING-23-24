Abstract


This project aims to implement an intelligent healthcare system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology for the remote monitoring of vital signs such as pulse rate, temperature, and SpO2. By utilizing ESP32 development kits for wireless wearable sensor control and server functions, the system enables efficient data transmission via Wi-Fi, reducing the need for in-person patient visits and facilitating simultaneous monitoring of numerous patients. Patient data is securely transmitted to a web server for storage in a centralized database, accessible anytime and anywhere through smart devices. Additionally, the system incorporates real-time alerts to notify healthcare professionals of any abnormalities, enhancing the timeliness and effectiveness of medical interventions. Through the seamless collection and recording of vital health information, including heart rate, temperature, and SpO2, this system offers healthcare providers flexibility and confidence in remote patient monitoring. Moreover, this project addresses the practical challenges encountered in the deployment and operation of IoT-based healthcare monitoring systems, contributing to the advancement and adoption of such technologies in real-world healthcare settings.

Literature Review:

In recent years, the integration of IoT technology into healthcare systems has garnered significant attention for its potential to revolutionize patient monitoring. Existing research has explored various approaches to IoT-based patient health monitoring, showcasing a range of innovative solutions. For instance, studies have introduced wearable IoT devices equipped with sensors to continuously monitor vital signs, as demonstrated by the work titled "Wearable IoT Device for Continuous Vital Sign Monitoring" (Published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2020). Additionally, cloud-based patient monitoring systems have been proposed using platforms like Raspberry Pi, enabling remote access to patient data for healthcare professionals, as evidenced by the paper "Cloud-Based Patient Monitoring System Using Raspberry Pi" (Presented at the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, 2018). Moreover, recent advancements in microcontroller technology have opened new possibilities for remote patient monitoring. The paper "ESP32 Microcontroller-Based Remote Health Monitoring System" (Published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2022) showcases the potential of utilizing microcontrollers like the ESP32 for real-time health monitoring applications. Furthermore, research presented in "Integration of ESP32 with Web Server for Real-Time Patient Health Monitoring" (Presented at the IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications, 2021) highlights the integration of ESP32 with web server technology, underscoring its viability for facilitating real-time communication and data analysis in patient monitoring systems. However, while these studies demonstrate the feasibility of IoT-based patient monitoring, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the utilization of specific microcontroller platforms like the ESP32 for hosting web server-based monitoring solutions. Further exploration is warranted in this area to fully leverage the potential of ESP32-based IoT solutions in healthcare.
